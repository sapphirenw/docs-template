description: Display sequential instructions in a numbered format
---

The Steps component helps you create clear, numbered instructions for multi-step processes.

## Basic Usage

Use `Steps` with `Step` components to create a numbered guide:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Run the following command to install required packages:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your project">
    Create a configuration file in your project root:
    ```bash
    touch docs.config.json
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start development">
    Launch the development server:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Code Example

```mdx
<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Description of the first step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
    Description of the second step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Third Step">
    Description of the third step.
  </Step>
</Steps>
```

## With Rich Content

Steps can contain any MDX content including code blocks, callouts, and other components:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/example/docs.git
    cd docs
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up environment">
    Create a `.env.local` file with your configuration:
    ```bash
    API_KEY=your_api_key
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
    ```
    <Warning>
      Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify installation">
    Run the test suite to ensure everything is working:
    ```bash
    pnpm test
    ```
    You should see all tests passing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Keep step titles concise and action-oriented. Use verbs like "Install", "Configure", "Create", or "Run".
</Tip>

- **Number of steps**: Aim for 3-7 steps. If you have more, consider breaking into multiple guides.
- **Step titles**: Use imperative verbs (Install, Configure, Deploy)
- **Step content**: Keep each step focused on a single action
- **Code blocks**: Include copy-able commands when relevant
