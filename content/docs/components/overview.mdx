## Using Components

All components are available globally in your MDX files. Simply use them like HTML tags:

```mdx
<Tip>
  This is a helpful tip for your readers!
</Tip>

<Card title="Learn More" href="/guides">
  Check out our guides for more information.
</Card>
```

<Info>
  Components automatically adapt to light and dark modes, so you don't need to worry about styling.

## Component Props

Each component accepts specific props to customize its behavior. Check the individual component pages for detailed documentation.

### Example: Callout Component

```mdx
<Callout type="warning" title="Custom Title">
  This is a warning callout with a custom title.
</Callout>
```

Renders as:

<Callout type="warning" title="Custom Title">
  This is a warning callout with a custom title.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

1. **Use semantic components** - Choose the right component for your content type
2. **Don't overuse** - Too many callouts or cards can overwhelm readers
3. **Keep content focused** - Each component should serve a clear purpose
4. **Test in both themes** - Verify your components look good in light and dark mode

<Note>
  All components are designed to be accessible and work with screen readers.
