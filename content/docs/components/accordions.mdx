description: Collapsible content sections for organizing information
---

Accordions are perfect for FAQs, troubleshooting guides, or any content where users might only need to see specific sections.

## Basic Usage

```mdx
<Accordion title="Click to expand">
  This content is hidden by default and revealed when clicked.
</Accordion>
```

<Accordion title="Click to expand">
  This content is hidden by default and revealed when clicked. You can put any content here, including code blocks, images, and other components.
</Accordion>

## Default Open

Use `defaultOpen` to start with the accordion expanded:

```mdx
<Accordion title="I'm open by default" defaultOpen>
  This accordion starts in the expanded state.
</Accordion>
```

<Accordion title="I'm open by default" defaultOpen>
  This accordion starts in the expanded state. Users can still collapse it by clicking the header.
</Accordion>

## Accordion Groups

Group related accordions together:

```mdx
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="First Question">
    Answer to the first question.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Second Question">
    Answer to the second question.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is this documentation platform?">
    This is a modern documentation platform built with Next.js and MDX. It provides a beautiful, fast, and customizable way to create documentation for your projects.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I customize the theme?">
    You can customize colors, fonts, and other design elements in the `tailwind.config.ts` file. The platform uses CSS variables for theming, making it easy to adjust the look and feel.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use my own components?">
    Yes! You can create custom MDX components and add them to the component mapping. This allows you to extend the platform with your own interactive elements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is it open source?">
    This platform is built for demonstration purposes. You can use the patterns and components as inspiration for your own documentation projects.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rich Content

Accordions can contain any MDX content:

<Accordion title="Example with code and callouts">
  Here's how to set up authentication:

  ```typescript
  import { auth } from './lib/auth';

  export async function middleware(request: Request) {
    const session = await auth();
    if (!session) {
      return Response.redirect('/login');
    }
  }
  ```

  <Warning>
    Make sure to keep your authentication secrets secure and never commit them to version control.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

## Best Practices

- **Write descriptive titles** - Users should know what's inside before expanding
- **Keep content focused** - Each accordion should cover one topic
- **Consider default state** - Open important sections by default
- **Don't nest too deep** - Avoid putting accordions inside accordions
