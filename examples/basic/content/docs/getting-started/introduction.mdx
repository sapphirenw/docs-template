description: A modern documentation platform built with Next.js and MDX
---

Welcome to the documentation! This platform is built to make creating beautiful, interactive documentation simple and enjoyable.

## What is doc-platform?

`doc-platform` is an npm package that provides a complete documentation system. You install it into a Next.js project, create a few thin route files, and provide your content as MDX files. All colors, fonts, navigation, and branding are driven by a single `docs.config.json` file.

It's inspired by [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com) and [GitBook](https://gitbook.com), but you own and host everything yourself.

<Tip>
  This entire documentation site is built using doc-platform. What you're reading right now is an example project consuming the package.

## Key Features

- **MDX Support** - Write Markdown and use React components
- **Dark Mode** - Beautiful dark and light themes
- **Search** - Lightning-fast search with keyboard shortcuts
- **Responsive** - Looks great on all devices
- **Components** - Rich set of documentation components
- **Config-Driven** - All branding from a single JSON file
- **Custom Fonts** - Use any Google Font
- **Syntax Highlighting** - Dual-theme code blocks via Shiki

## How It Works

You provide:

1. **`docs.config.json`** — site name, colors, navigation structure, links
2. **`content/docs/**/*.mdx`** — your documentation pages
3. **`public/`** — logos and images
4. **4 route files in `src/app/`** — boilerplate that wires up the handlers (~5 lines each)

The package provides everything else: layout, sidebar, search, table of contents, MDX components, and theming.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the package">
    ```bash
    pnpm add doc-platform next@^16 react@^19 react-dom@^19
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your route files">
    Set up four thin files in `src/app/` that import handler factories from the package. See the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) for the exact code.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your config and content">
    Create `docs.config.json` with your site name, colors, and navigation. Write your docs as MDX files in `content/docs/`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview locally">
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
